### üéâ Major Release - Comprehensive Fix & Enhancement Update

This release represents a complete overhaul of the Party Vision module, addressing all known issues and implementing missing core functionality.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Form Party System (Previously Missing!)

- Visual member list with portraits and movement speed display
- Remembers last used formation preset

#### Enhanced Dialogs
- Improved Deploy Party dialog with better styling and UX
- Better visual feedback for direction selection
- Remembers last deployment direction
- Split party dialog with member selection checkboxes

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Formation Rotation (CRITICAL FIX)
- **FIXED**: Formation rotation now correctly rotates around the leader as center point
- **FIXED**: Replaced flawed radian-based rotation with 90-degree step rotation system
- **FIXED**: Leader now stays at party token position during deployment
- **FIXED**: Member offsets properly maintained during rotation
- New functions: `rotateOffset()` and `calculateRotationSteps()`
- All deployment directions (north, east, south, west) now work correctly

#### API and Function Exports
- **FIXED**: Added `showDeployDialog` to `window.PartyVision` exports
- **FIXED**: Added `showFormPartyDialog` to `window.PartyVision` exports  
- **FIXED**: Added `formParty` to `window.PartyVision` exports
- **FIXED**: Added `toggleFollowLeaderMode` to `window.PartyVision` exports
- HUD buttons now properly access exported functions

#### Combat Integration
- **FIXED**: Added 500ms delay before showing deploy dialog on combat start
- **FIXED**: Added comprehensive error handling for auto-deploy
- **FIXED**: Added try-catch blocks to prevent race conditions
- **FIXED**: Auto-form on combat end now properly calls function instead of missing macro

#### Lighting System
- **FIXED**: Enhanced multi-strategy lighting detection for system compatibility
- **FIXED**: Checks prototype token light AND active effects for light sources
- **FIXED**: Proper light restoration when deploying party members
- **FIXED**: Debounced lighting updates to prevent performance issues

- Graceful degradation on errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Enhanced console logging for debugging

#### Code Quality
- Consistent function documentation
- Clear variable naming
- Modular function design
- Removed duplicate code

### üé® UI/UX Improvements

- Foundry VTT v13 (latest)
- Pathfinder 2e system v7.5+
- D&D 5e system (latest)
- Generic system

Test scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Form party with 2-8 members
- ‚úÖ Deploy party in all 4 directions
- ‚úÖ Formation rotation accuracy
- ‚úÖ Split party functionality
- ‚úÖ Combat integration (auto-deploy/form)
- ‚úÖ Lighting synchronization
- ‚úÖ Follow-the-leader mode
- ‚úÖ Wall collision detection
- ‚úÖ Multi-size token handling

### üìù Notes

- Minimum Foundry version: v13
- libWrapper dependency required (unchanged)
- All user data and settings preserved during update
- No migration needed from v2.4.x
